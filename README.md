# Crime clarification analysis with Probit model
Analyisis of crime reports in Uruguay and prediction of whether a case will be clarified using a Probit regression model.
It includes data cleaning, exporatory analysis, and evaluation of the model performance.

# Wage and salary earnings multivariate linear regression
The objective of this project is to build a regression model that explains variations in wages across industries and demographics for the US, using a population survey. The project includes exploring the variables from tables with SQL, preparing the variables in a csv file, processing the data, evaluating the model and interpreting the coefficients.

# Words classification
This is an Naive Bayes classification exercise from https://www.mooc.fi/en

This project implements a machine learning model that classifies words as either Finnish or English.
It reads word lists from files, processes them, and uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to predict the language of unseen words. 
Cross-validation is used to evaluate the model's performance.

# Cointegration analysis and environmental kuznets curve in Uruguay 1984-2014
Test for the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis, and cointegration analysis between real GDP per capita, GHG emissions per capita, Fossil fuel energy consumption and Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added in Uruguay between 1984 and 2014.

# Credit risk prediction
Simple credit risk prediction using logit regression, random forest and naive bayes classifier, using German credit data.

# Clustering German sentences
This project applies unsupervised machine learning to a custom dataset of German sentences to explore semantic clustering. Using K-Means clustering, the goal was to group similar sentences based on vocabulary usage.
To visualize and interpret clusters, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied for dimenssion reduction. Clustering quality/accuracy was assessed using the silhouette score.
